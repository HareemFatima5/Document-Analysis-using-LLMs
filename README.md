It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Document_Analysis_using_LLMs.ipynb`) and can be adapted for different document types such as text, PDFs, or reports.


## Features
- Preprocesses and cleans raw document data  
- Uses LLMs for:
  - Text summarization
  - Question answering
  - Information extraction  
- Extendable for custom datasets
